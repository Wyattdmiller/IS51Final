""" Structured English
This program opens the file Final.txt, which is a list of student grades on a final exam. 
It then creates a list, where each item of the list is a line of the file.
It displays the number of items in the list, which is the number of grades.
It then sums the grades in the list, and divides that by the number of grades to get an average.
It will display the average.
Then it will check each grade in the list and compare it to the average.
It will keep track of how many grades were above the average,
and display that number as a percentage of the number of grades.
